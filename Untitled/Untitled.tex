\abstract{Behavioral scientists have multiple options for managing
research data. While relational databases offer robust tools for storage
and analysis, they impose structural constraints that limit the
representation of complex behavioral phenomena. This article argues that
graph databases provide a rigorous and conceptually richer alternative,
enabling the modeling of human behavior as an interconnected system
rather than a set of isolated variables. Beyond a technological shift,
adopting graph-based approaches invites a paradigm change in behavior
science---one that embraces complexity, dynamic relationships, and
multi-level contingencies. Practical implications are illustrated
through examples from clinical, consumer, and industrial/organizational
psychology.}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

In a recent paper, \citet{soto2025} introduced relational databases for
behavior science and used real-world examples to illustrate how
relational databases have been used by behavioral scientists. Although
relational databases remain the dominant paradigm in research and
industry, alternative approaches are gaining traction. The so-called
`Not Only SQL' (NoSQL) category includes database systems that employ
non-tabular data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, wide
columns, matrices, and graphs. Whereas relational databases store
structured data in tables (i.e., columns as variables, rows as cases,
and cells containing specific values), NoSQL systems accommodate
flexible formats that better support evolving and highly connected data.

In this article, I examine graphs as a paradigm that deviates from the
traditional lenses of relational databases, where nodes and edges
(instead of tables and joins) represent the basic elements of any
behavior that can be represented as a network or a complex system.
Networks have a long history in mathematics as ``\emph{graph theory}''
\citep{Estrada2011}. In sociology and social sciences, graph theory is
known as ``social network analysis'' \citep{Wasserman1994}. In this
context, the term ``social network'' should not be confused with online
platforms such as Facebook or Instagram, as they are technological
implementations that do not necessarily represent all aspects of social
networks as a discipline. Psychologists have leveraged this framework to
analyze the structure of psychopathology \citep{borsboom2013}, conduct
bibliometric analysis of cyberbehavior \citep{serafin2019}, estimate the
correct number of dimensions in psychological and educational
instruments \citep{golino2017}, or understand the measurement of
organizational climate \citep{menezes2021}.

\section{Network as a collection nodes and edges}\label{sec2}

\citet{Estrada2011} defines a network as a collection of points (called
nodes) joined together in pairs by lines (called arcs or edges) like
those depicted in Figure \hyperref[fig:F1]{1}. Despite this simplistic
definition, networks provide a powerful framework to model any type of
system from planets in a galaxy to neurons in the nervous system
\citep{Vazza2020}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=380px,]{../F1} 

}

\caption{A visual representation of four types of networks: A) non-directed unweighted network, B) non-directed weighted network, C) directed unweighted network, and D) directed weighted network.}\label{fig:F1}
\end{figure}

In behavioral sciences, networks have been used to understand the
mechanisms of team assembly and how these mechanisms determine
collaboration structure and team performance \citep{guimera2005}. Graphs
offer fundamental concepts for understanding how entities (nodes) and
their relationships (edges) form interconnected structures. From a data
management viewpoint, the analysis of these networks requires tools that
go beyond the rigid tabular constraints of relational databases. As the
concepts of graphs are thoroughly covered in introductory texts
\citep{Newman2010}, these will not be revisited here. Instead, this
article aims to illustrate how graph-based databases can enrich the
methodological toolbox of behavioral scientists, enabling analyses that
embrace complexity, dynamic relationships, and multi-level contingencies
\citep{Robinson2015}.

\section{Graph databases: A gentle
introduction}\label{graph-databases-a-gentle-introduction}

\citet{Robinson2015} define a graph database as a system that implements
\textbf{C}reate, \textbf{R}ead, \textbf{U}pdate, and \textbf{D}elete
(CRUD) operations on a graph data model, where entities are represented
as nodes and relationships as edges like the one depicted in Figure
\hyperref[fig:F2]{2}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=350px,height=180px,]{../F2} 

}

\caption{A visual representation of a graph database that combines persons, companies, and routes}\label{fig:F2}
\end{figure}

Unlike relational databases, which organize data in tables, graph
databases treat relationships as first-class elements rather than
secondary links between tables. This design enables efficient traversal
and pattern matching across highly connected data, making it ideal for
modeling complex networks such as behavioral contingencies or social
interactions. Nodes in Figure \hyperref[fig:F2]{2} refers to real-world
entities such as persons (i.e., Anna, Pam, Carlos, and John) companies
(i.e., Chevron and Rice University), and routes (i.e., I-10 and I-45).
Edges represent the relationship between pairs of nodes. Thus, John and
Pam work in Chevron but they commute distinct distances through
different routes. Carlos and Anna work in Rice University, they both
commute by the same route but they have to drive different distances.
Interestingly, the information of nodes and edges can be enriched with
attributes. These attributes also represent real-world characteristics
like the distance each person has to commute, their sex, or the sector
of the company they work for.

A graph database model like the one depicted in Figure
\hyperref[fig:F2]{2} leverages the so-called ``labeled property graph''
which has the following elements: 1) nodes and relationships, 2) nodes
contain properties (key-value pairs), 3) nodes can be labeled with one
or more labels, 4) relationships are named and directed, and always have
a start and end node, 5) relationships can also contain properties.
Although these elements offer significant benefits for behavioral
scientists, they have been largely overlooked. This gap presents an
opportunity to enrich the methodological toolbox for behavior analysts
working in both basic and applied settings, particularly those
interested in integrating methods from other disciplines into behavioral
sciences.

According to \citet{Robinson2015}, one advantage of graph database
models is their superior performance when handling connected data
compared to relational databases that rely on tabular structures. In
relational databases, join-intensive queries slow down as datasets grow,
whereas graph databases maintain relatively stable performance---even
with millions of nodes and edges. While big data challenges may not
concern experimental behavior analysts working with small laboratory
datasets, applied behavior analysts can benefit significantly from graph
databases. For example, consider analyzing urban traffic at an
individual level by tracking the movements of hundreds of thousands of
drivers every two hours \citep{Gonzalez2008}. In such cases, graph
databases excel because queries operate on localized portions of the
graph rather than scanning the entire dataset. If edges store
information such as commuting distances, queries can be designed to
retrieve specific conditions (e.g., individuals who commute less than 10
miles). Consequently, execution time depends only on the size of the
subgraph traversed, not the overall graph size.

Another advantage of graph databases has to do with their flexibility.
Behavioral scientists aim to connect data in ways that reflect their
knowledge and expertise. This is why graph databases serve as the
underlying infrastructure for constructing ``knowledge graphs''
\citep{Barrasa2023}. With these knowledge graphs, researchers allow the
database to evolve alongside their understanding of the behavioral
phenomenon rather than being rigidly defined upfront, when knowledge is
most limited. This is particularly important when a behavioral
phenomenon lacks theoretical background or lacks replication
\citep{burgos2025}. Graph databases fulfill this need by providing a
flexible model that adapts to changing requirements and evidence.
Because graphs are inherently additive, new nodes, relationships,
labels, and subgraphs can be introduced. The modifications introduced to
the original graph do not imply a threat to existing queries or
application functionality. This flexibility minimizes the need for
exhaustive upfront modeling and lowers the frequency of costly
migrations (particularly for companies that hire behavior data
scientists in charge of analyzing customers observed behavior), thereby
reducing maintenance overhead.

A third benefit of graph databases is the agility that they offer.
Modern graph databases enable smooth development and easy system
maintenance. Their schema-free design, combined with testable APIs and
query languages, allows controlled evolution of applications. While the
absence of rigid schemas means traditional governance mechanisms are
missing, this is not a drawback. On the contrary, it encourages more
transparent and actionable data governance. Typically, governance is
enforced programmatically through tests that validate data models,
queries, and business rules. This approach aligns well with agile and
test-driven development practices, making graph database applications
adaptable to changing business needs.

It is worth mentioning that relational databases acknowledge
relationships, but only during modeling, where they serve as join
mechanisms between tables. In graph databases, we often need to clarify
the meaning of relationships and even qualify their strength. These are
aspects that relational database management systems do not address
explicitly \citep{Robinson2015}. From this viewpoint, graph databases
demand ontological considerations such as those recently described for
psychology and behavioral sciences \citep{burgos2025}. As datasets grow
more complex and less uniform, relational data management systems like
Microsoft Access, PostgreSQL, or SQLite become burdened with large join
tables, sparsely populated rows, and extensive null-checking logic.
Greater interconnectedness in relational databases leads to more joins,
which degrade performance and complicate adaptation to evolving
requirements. \citet{soto2025} has highlighted some of these limitations
as ``challenges to adoption.'' From the lenses of graph databases,
however, these challenges are not even necessary. I will elaborate upon
this particular aspect below.

\section{Applying graph database in behavioral
research}\label{applying-graph-database-in-behavioral-research}

To illustrate the application of graph databases for behavioral
scientists, I revisit data from customers who used an online food
delivery platform in the city of Bogotá. The database is available in a
public data repository \citep{segura2019} and its associated research
article \citep{correa2019a}. Behavioral scientists who are familiar with
structured datasets will find that this database is in a coma-separated
values (.csv) file, just like most tables used in relational database
management systems like Microsoft Access or SQLite. Given the wide
variety of graph database management systems in the market (e.g., Neo4j,
Microsoft Azure Cosmos, Aerospike, Amazon Web Services Neptune,
NebulaGraph, Memgraph, TigerGraph, Giraph), the rest of this work relies
on Neo4j \citep{Barrasa2023}. Neo4j ranks as the leading freemium
software in the segment of graph database management systems and has
been used in several industry sectors including retail, finance,
pharmaceutics, hospitality, and electronic commerce, among others. Neo4j
offers free and enterprise editions, which can be installed on local or
server environments following official documentation. As the official
documentation provides helpful material for newcomers, downloading and
installation details are not necessary here, and the reader can consult
specific details elsewhere \citep{vanBruggen2014}.

\subsection{Instance creation and data
import}\label{instance-creation-and-data-import}

Instance creation is the first step in using graph databases with Neo4j.
This is a top-level operation for setting up a new database environment,
and involves allocating resources (memory, CPU, storage), defining a
database version, and setting up initial user credentials by clicking
one button. When creating a new instance, neo4j asks the user to provide
a name as part of the instance details. The user is asked to provide a
password of eight characters as a security check for further
interactions. The instance created is called ``OFD,'' an acronym for
``Online Food Delivery.'' Figure \hyperref[fig:F3]{3} depicts this
instance which by default is ``stopped.'' The user should start the
instance by clicking the button ``Start instance'' that is at the top
right of the window. This action will create two default databases
(i.e., neo4j and system).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=380px,height=100px,]{../F3} 

}

\caption{The look-and-feel of an instance created in neo4j}\label{fig:F3}
\end{figure}

Our database can be easily uploaded by moving the mouse to the left
panel of neo4j and clicking on the icon ``import'' depicted with a red
circle in Figure \hyperref[fig:F4]{4}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=380px,height=200px,]{../F4} 

}

\caption{The drag-and-drop import files option in the left panel of neo4j}\label{fig:F4}
\end{figure}

As described above, the database is a csv file (newdata.csv) with a
total of 19 variables. According to \citet{segura2019}, this database
was developed with the goal of evaluating the impact of traffic
conditions on key performance indicators of a sample of 787 restaurants
with food delivery services in Bogotá City. It includes the physical
location of both restaurants and 4,296 customers, as well as key
performance indicators and traffic descriptions captured by the Google
Maps API at three time points during Saturday rush hours.

\subsection{Understanding the context}\label{understanding-the-context}

According to \citet{correa2019a}, real traffic conditions in cities like
Bogotá can have an impact on how customers evaluate food delivery
services such as UberEATS, Just-Eat, or ClickDelivery. As the traffic in
this city has long suffered congestion problems, local governmental
authorities have decided to impose a restriction program called ``Pico y
Placa.'' As per \citet{montero2025}, this program was introduced in
August 1998 and over the years the restriction has been modified several
times looking to extend its scope. For example, since July 2012, Pico y
Placa affects the half of residential and commercial vehicles every
other day of the week (excluding weekends) from 6:00 to 8:30 a.m. and
then from 3:00 to 7:30 p.m, and buses, police cars, ambulances, fire
trucks, government and diplomatic vehicles, school buses and vans, and
electric and hybrid vehicles are exempt. To decide which half of the
fleet is restricted in any given day, the Pico y Placa follows an
odd--even schedule based on the last digit of the vehicle's license
plate \citep{montero2025}.

In this context, \citet{correa2019a} reported that the data collected
from Google Maps API indicated that rush hours occur three times during
Saturdays: in the morning (between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m); around midday
(between 12:00 and 2:00 p.m); and in the evenings (between 6:00 and 8:00
p.m). Based on this information, \citet{correa2019a} classiﬁed the
typical traﬃc in three categories: ``free'' or ``green traﬃc'' (G),
``average'' or ``orange traﬃc'' (O), and ``heavy'' or ``red traﬃc'' (R).
By using letter triads they characterized the typical daily traﬃc with
sequences like ``G-G-G'' or ``R-O-R.'' Thus, for example, the sequence
``R-O-G'' means that the typical traﬃc changes from ``red'' in the
morning to ``orange'' at noon and ``green'' in the afternoon, describing
a place where traﬃc conditions improve as time passes.

\subsection{Sketching a graph database
model}\label{sketching-a-graph-database-model}

Sketching a graph database model is the next step after a successful
data import in Neo4j. Given the benefits of the labeled property graph,
an initial model can be modified multiple times. These modifications are
important because they reflect the analyst's expertise and highlight
critical nodes and relationships to be mapped. An initial graph database
model can consider the following schema depicted in Figure
\hyperref[fig:F5]{5}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=380px,height=200px,]{../F5} 

}

\caption{The drag-and-drop import files option in the left panel of neo4j}\label{fig:F5}
\end{figure}

This graph model is the result of a series of cypher syntaxes like the
following one

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{CYPHER 5 CREATE CONSTRAINT \textasciigrave{}Typical\_Traffic Afternoon\_TrafficPM\_uniq\textasciigrave{} IF NOT EXISTS}
\NormalTok{FOR (n: \textasciigrave{}TrafficPM\textasciigrave{})}
