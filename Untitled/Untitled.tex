\abstract{Behavioral scientists have multiple options for managing
research data. While relational databases offer robust tools for storage
and analysis, they impose structural constraints that limit the
representation of complex behavioral phenomena. This article argues that
graph databases provide a rigorous and conceptually richer alternative,
enabling the modeling of human behavior as an interconnected system
rather than a set of isolated variables. Beyond a technological shift,
adopting graph-based approaches invites a paradigm change in behavior
science---one that embraces complexity, dynamic relationships, and
multi-level contingencies. Practical implications are illustrated
through examples from clinical, consumer, and industrial/organizational

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

In a recent paper, \citet{soto2025} introduced relational databases for
behavior science and used real-world examples to illustrate how
relational databases have been used by behavioral scientists. Although
relational databases remain the dominant paradigm in research and
industry, alternative approaches are gaining traction. The so-called
`Not Only SQL' (NoSQL) category includes database systems that employ
non-tabular data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, wide
columns, matrices, and graphs. Whereas relational databases store
structured data in tables (i.e., columns as variables, rows as cases,
and cells containing specific values), NoSQL systems accommodate
flexible formats that better support evolving and highly connected data.

In this article, I examine graphs as a paradigm that deviates from the
traditional lenses of relational databases, where nodes and edges
(instead of tables and joins) represent the basic elements of any
behavior that can be represented as a network or a complex system.
Networks have a long history in mathematics as ``\emph{graph theory}''
\citep{Estrada2011}. In sociology and social sciences, graph theory is
known as ``social network analysis'' \citep{Wasserman1994}. In this
context, the term ``social network'' should not be confused with online
platforms such as Facebook or Instagram, as they are technological
implementations that do not necessarily represent all aspects of social
networks as a discipline. Psychologists have leveraged this framework to
analyze the structure of psychopathology \citep{borsboom2013}, conduct
bibliometric analysis of cyberbehavior \citep{serafin2019}, estimate the
correct number of dimensions in psychological and educational
instruments \citep{golino2017}, or understand the measurement of
organizational climate \citep{menezes2021}.

\section{Network as a collection nodes and edges}\label{sec2}

One of the easiest way to grasp the idea of a network is by looking its
visual representation (see Figure \hyperref[fig:F1]{1}).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=200px,]{../F1} 

}

\caption{A visual representation of four types of simple networks: non-directed unweighted network (upper left), non-directed weighted network (upper right), directed unweighted network (bottom left), and directed weighted network (bottom right).}\label{fig:F1}
\end{figure}

According to \citet{Estrada2011}, a network is a collection of points
(called nodes) joined together in pairs by lines (called arcs or edges).
Despite this simplistic definition, networks provide a powerful
framework to model any type of system from planets in a galaxy to
neurons in the nervous system \citep{Vazza2020}. In behavioral sciences,
networks have been used to understand the mechanisms of team assembly
and how these mechanisms determine collaboration structure and team
performance \citep{guimera2005}. Graphs offer fundamental concepts for
understanding how entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) form
interconnected structures. From a data management viewpoint, the
analysis of these networks requires tools that go beyond the rigid
tabular constraints of relational databases. As the concepts of graphs
are thoroughly covered in introductory texts \citep{Newman2010}, these
will not be revisited here. Instead, this article aims to illustrate how
graph-based databases can enrich the methodological toolbox of
behavioral scientists, enabling analyses that embrace complexity,
dynamic relationships, and multi-level contingencies
\citep{Robinson2015}.

\section{Graph databases: A gentle
introduction}\label{graph-databases-a-gentle-introduction}

\citet{Robinson2015} define a graph database as a system that implements
\textbf{C}reate, \textbf{R}ead, \textbf{U}pdate, and \textbf{D}elete
(CRUD) operations on a graph data model, where entities are represented
as nodes and relationships as edges. Unlike relational databases, which
organize data in tables, graph databases treat relationships as
first-class elements rather than secondary links between tables. This
design enables efficient traversal and pattern matching across highly
connected data, making it ideal for modeling complex networks such as
behavioral contingencies or social interactions.

Figure \hyperref[fig:F2]{2} shows a graph with eight nodes and eight
edges. Nodes represent real-world entities such as persons (i.e., Anna,
Pam, Carlos, and John) companies (i.e., Chevron and Rice University),
and routes (i.e., I-10 and I-45). Edges represent the relationship
between pairs of nodes. Thus, John and Pam work in Chevron but they
commute distinct distances through different routes. Carlos and Anna
work in Rice University, they both commute by the same route but they
have to drive different distances. Interestingly, the information of
nodes and edges can be enriched with attributes. These attributes also
represent real-world characteristics like the distance each person has
to commute, their sex, or the sector of the company they work for. A
graph database like the one depicted in Figure \hyperref[fig:F2]{2}
leverages the so-called ``labeled property graph'' which has the
following elements: 1) nodes and relationships, 2) nodes contain
properties (key-value pairs), 3) nodes can be labeled with one or more
labels, 4) relationships are named and directed, and always have a start
and end node, 5) relationships can also contain properties. Although
these elements offer significant benefits for behavioral scientists,
they have been largely overlooked. This gap presents an opportunity to
enrich the methodological toolbox for behavior analysts working in both
basic and applied settings, particularly those interested in integrating
methods from other disciplines into behavioral sciences.

\end{figure}

According to \citet{Robinson2015}, one advantage of graph databases is
their superior performance when handling connected data compared to
relational databases that rely on tabular structures. In relational
databases, join-intensive queries slow down as datasets grow, whereas
graph databases maintain relatively stable performance---even with
millions of nodes and edges. While big data challenges may not concern
experimental behavior analysts working with small laboratory datasets,
applied behavior analysts can benefit significantly from graph
databases. For example, consider analyzing urban traffic at an
individual level by tracking the movements of hundreds of thousands of
drivers every two hours \citep{Gonzalez2008}. In such cases, graph
databases excel because queries operate on localized portions of the
graph rather than scanning the entire dataset. If edges store
information such as commuting distances, queries can be designed to
retrieve specific conditions (e.g., individuals who commute less than 10
miles). Consequently, execution time depends only on the size of the
subgraph traversed, not the overall graph size.

Another advantage of graph databases has to do with their flexibility.
Behavioral scientists aim to connect data in ways that reflect their
knowledge and expertise. This is a key reason why graph databases serve
as the underlying infrastructure for constructing ``knowledge graphs''
\citep{Barrasa2023}. With these knowledge graphs, behavioral scientists
allow the structure and schema to evolve alongside their understanding
of the behavioral phenomenon rather than being rigidly defined upfront,
when knowledge is most limited. This is particularly important when a
behavioral phenomenon lacks theoretical background or lacks replication
\citep{burgos2025}. Graph databases fulfill this need by providing a
flexible model that adapts to changing requirements and evidence.
Because graphs are inherently additive, new nodes, relationships,
labels, and subgraphs can be introduced. The modifications introduced to
the original graph do not imply a threat to existing queries or
application functionality. This flexibility minimizes the need for
exhaustive upfront modeling and lowers the frequency of costly
migrations (particularly for companies that hire behavior data
scientists who use to be in charge of analyzing customers observed
behavior), thereby reducing maintenance overhead.

A third benefit of graph databases is the agility that they offer.
Modern graph databases enable smooth development and easy system
maintenance. Their schema-free design, combined with testable APIs and
query languages, allows controlled evolution of applications. While the
absence of rigid schemas means traditional governance mechanisms are
missing, this is not a drawback. On the contrary, it encourages more
transparent and actionable data governance. Typically, governance is
enforced programmatically through tests that validate data models,
queries, and business rules. This approach aligns well with agile and
test-driven development practices, making graph database--based
applications adaptable to changing business needs.

It is worth mentioning that relational databases acknowledge
relationships, but only during modeling, where they serve as join
mechanisms between tables. In graph databases, we often need to clarify
the meaning of relationships and even qualify their strength. These are
aspects that relational database management systems do not address
explicitly \citep{Robinson2015}. From this viewpoint, graph databases
demand ontological considerations such as those recently described for
psychology and behavioral sciences \citep{burgos2025}. As datasets grow
more complex and less uniform, relational data management systems like
Microsoft Access, PostgreSQL, or SQLite become burdened with large join
tables, sparsely populated rows, and extensive null-checking logic.
Greater interconnectedness in relational databases leads to more joins,
which degrade performance and complicate adaptation to evolving
requirements. \citet{soto2025} has highlighted some of these limitations
as ``challenges to adoption.'' From the lenses of graph databases,
however, these challenges are not even necessary. I will elaborate upon
this particular aspect below.

\section{Behavioral Application of graph
databases}\label{behavioral-application-of-graph-databases}

To illustrate the application of graph databases for behavioral
scientists, I revisit data from customers who used an online food
delivery platform in the city of Bogotá. The database is available in a
public data repository \citep{segura2019} and its associated research
article \citep{correa2019a}. Behavioral scientists who are familiar with
structured datasets will find that this database is in a coma separated
value (.csv) file, just like most tables used in relational database
management systems like Microsoft Access or SQLite. Given the variety of
graph database management systems (e.g., Microsoft Azure Cosmos, AWS
Neptune, Neo4j, Aerospike), the rest of this work relies on Neo4j
\citep{Barrasa2023}.
