  As researchers, behavior scientists can use many options for data collection, storage, and analysis. Graphs-based data science provides a unified framework that facilitates the understanding of human behavior as a complex system. This article argues for the benefits, utility, and rigor that behavior science can gain as a discipline by adopting graphs as an alternative paradigm to relational databases. The article provides use cases from three APA's division: clinical psychology, consumer psychology, and industrial/organizational psychology.

# Introduction {#sec1}

In a recent paper, @soto2025 introduced relational databases for behavior science and used real-world examples to illustrate how relational databases have been used by behavior scientists.
Even though relational databases represent the dominant paradigm inside and outside academic research settings, other paradigms are gaining traction [@golino2017].

Our work, in contrast, introduces graphs as an alternative paradigm to relational databases, where nodes and arcs (instead of tables and joins) represent the basic elements of any behavior that can be represented as a network or complex system.
Networks have a long history in mathematics as "*graph theory*" [@Estrada2011].
In sociology and social sciences, graph theory is known as "*social network analysis*" [@Wasserman1994], and psychologists have levearaged this framework to understand the structure of psychopathology [@borsboom2013].

# Network as a collection nodes and edges {#sec2}

One of the easiest way to grasp the idea of a network is by looking its visual representation (see Figure [1](#fig:F1)).
According to @Estrada2011, a network is a collection of points (called nodes) joined together in pairs by lines (called arcs or edges).
Scientists can model different kinds of networks from physical networks (e.g., flights between airports) to biological networks (e.g., protein-protein interactions), and social networks (e.g., who follows whom in LinkedIn or X).
In this context, the term "social network" should not be confused with online platforms such as Facebook or Instagram, as they are technological implementations that do not necessarily represent all aspects of social networks as an academic discipline.

```{r F1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A visual representation of four types of simple networks: non-directed unweighted network (upper left), non-directed weighted network (upper right), di- rected unweighted network (bottom left), and directed weighted network (bottom right).", fig.align="center", out.width="227px", fig.pos="H"}

```

Graphs provide a series of fundamental concepts that facilitate how nodes connect and understand the structure of these links.
For example, some networks might look loosely structured which means that it has few connections between nodes and most nodes are isolated or poorly connected.
In other cases, the network is densely connected which means that almost all nodes connect with the rest of the nodes.
Networks structure is fundamental to a wide range of behavioral phenomena including all kinds of spreads of a disease, all kinds of clustering, and other social behavior including propagation of rumors or fake news.

## Configurations

A configuration is a specific pattern of connections between nodes.
The most elementary configuration is a dyad (two connected nodes).
Other common configurations include triangles (three nodes, all connected to each other) and k-stars (a central node connected to k other nodes).
These configurations, along with others, make up the larger connected subgraphs of a network, known as components.
A component is a set of nodes where a path exists between every pair of nodes.
A component is a maximal connected subgraph, where all nodes within it are reachable from each other, and it is not connected to any other nodes.
A component can be as simple as a long line of connected nodes with no triangles or k-stars.
A path is a fundamental concept that describes a sequence of connections between nodes.
It is the route one can follow to travel from one node to another.
Paths are essential for understanding properties like the shortest distance between any pair of nodes.
A special type of path is a cycle, which is a closed path with no repeated nodes or edges other than the start and end nodes.
A cycle has a minimum of three links (e.g., a triangle).
From the network science perspective, geometric structures like squares, pentagons, or decagons can all be seen as cycles.
The four types of configurations in a network are depicted in Figure [2](#fig:F2).

```{r F2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic configurations in a network: dyads (top left), k-stars (top right), triples and triangles (bottom left), and components (bottom right).", fig.align="center", out.width="227px", fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/jcc/Documents/GitHub/NOSQLINBS/F2.png")
```

In the analysis of social networks, it is very important to distinguish between connected and disconnected networks [@Wasserman1994].
When a network is connected there is a path between every pair of nodes; that is, you can reach any node from any other node.
In a disconnected network some paths do not exist (i.e., some nodes are isolated and not reachable).
The nodes in a disconnected network can be partitioned into two or more subsets in which there are no paths between the nodes in different subsets.
The connected sub-networks in a network are called components.
A component is a sub-network in which there is a path between all pairs of nodes and there is no path between a node in a component and any node other node in the other component.

## Nodal Centrality

Nodal centrality relates to the amount of connections a given node has, and can be computed in different ways [@oldham2019].
Nodal degree is the most basic way of estimating a node centrality.
It requires counting the number of lines incident with it.
For example, the nodal degree of the central node in the 3-star network depicted in the top right of Figure [2](#fig:F2) is three.

Note that nodal centrality is a property of every single node in a network, and when the analysis of a social network focuses on nodes centrality, this estimation is done to every single node in the network.

# Applications of Network Modeling

Network modeling has been used by psychologists and behavioral scientists in several ways that fit into the professional goals of well-established APA's divisions such as quantitative and qualitative methods (division 5), clinical psychology (division 12), and industrial and organizational psychology (division 14).
The following subsections summarize how network modeling has been applied in these subdisciplines.

## Network modeling as a quantitative method {#sec3}

@golino2017 illustrated the principles by which network modeling can be used as a framework for estimating the correct number of dimensions in psychological and educational instruments.
While traditional techniques such as "parallel analysis" and "minimum average partial" are widely utilized, they often underestimate the number of factors in scenarios involving high correlations between latent variables, small sample sizes, or few indicators per factor.
Conversely, the widely used Kaiser-Guttman rule is frequently criticized for overestimating the number of factors, particularly as sample sizes and the number of items increase.

In response to these limitations, "exploratory graph analysis" has been developed as a new approach derived from the field of network psychometrics [@epskamp2018].
This framework utilizes Markov random fields to model the interaction between random variables as a network of nodes (variables) and edges (direct relationships).
Specifically, EGA employs the **Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM)**, which models the multivariate distribution through the inverse covariance matrix.
When these elements are standardized, they represent **partial correlation coefficients**.
A fundamental tenet of this approach is the "Clusters in network = latent variables" rule: if a latent variable model represents the true causal structure, its indicators will manifest as strongly connected clusters (or cliques) within the network because they cannot become independent after conditioning on other observed variables.

**The EGA Procedure** The EGA framework follows a rigorous three-step statistical sequence to identify the underlying dimensionality of a dataset:

1\.
**Estimation:** The correlation matrix of observable variables is estimated (e.g., tetrachoric or polychoric correlations for categorical data).

2\.
**Regularization:** To prevent overfitting and the inclusion of spurious correlations common in typical psychological sample sizes, the **graphical LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)** is applied.
The sparsity of the resulting network is optimized by selecting a regularization parameter that minimizes the **Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC)**.

3\.
**Community Detection:** The **walktrap algorithm**—a random walk-based procedure—is used to identify dense subgraphs or communities within the regularized partial correlation matrix.
The number of detected communities corresponds to the estimated number of latent dimensions.

**Empirical Performance and Accuracy** Extensive simulation research involving **32,000 datasets** across 64 conditions has demonstrated that EGA is highly robust.
While it performs comparably to traditional methods in two-factor structures, EGA significantly outperforms them in **four-factor structures with high correlations (.70)** between dimensions.
In these complex scenarios, EGA was often the only technique capable of maintaining high accuracy, reaching 100% accuracy with a sample size of 5,000.
Furthermore, analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that EGA’s accuracy is the **least affected** by varying experimental conditions, such as sample size and factor correlation, compared to traditional techniques.

**Additional Methodological Benefits** Beyond estimating the total number of dimensions, EGA provides a distinct advantage by automatically identifying **which specific items indicate each retrieved dimension**.
This dual functionality—dimensionality estimation and item membership identification—provides a more comprehensive output for construct validation than traditional factor-retention rules.
Empirical application to the **Inductive Reasoning Developmental Test (IRDT)** further validates the framework, as EGA correctly identified seven dimensions that matched the instrument's theoretical developmental stages, while other methods like Parallel Analysis suggested only four

# Equations {#sec4}

Equations in \LaTeX can either be inline or on-a-line by itself ("display equations").
For inline equations use the `$...$` commands.
E.g.: The equation $H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command `$H \psi = E \psi$`.

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers) one can use the equation or align environments:

\begin{equation}
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^2 \leq\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_i(k)\right\|^2+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_j(k)\right\|^2 }{p+q}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}

where, \begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu \label{eq2}
\end{align}

Notice the use of `\nonumber` in the align environment at the end of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on lines where no equation numbers are required.
The `\label{}` command should only be used at the last line of an align environment where `\nonumber` is not used.

\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}

The class file also supports the use of `\mathbb{}`, `\mathscr{}` and `\mathcal{}` commands.
As such `\mathbb{R}`, `\mathscr{R}` and `\mathcal{R}` produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ respectively (refer Subsubsection \ref{subsubsec2}).

# Tables {#sec5}

Tables can be inserted via the normal `knitr::kable()` function or other table-generating packages.

```{r tab1}
knitr::kable(head(pressure), 
             format = "latex", 
             caption = "Caption text")
```

Tables can also be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment.
To put footnotes inside tables you should use `\footnotetext[]{...}` tag.
The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables\~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}).
For the corresponding footnotemark use `\footnotemark[...]`

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Caption text}\label{tab1}%
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Column 1 & Column 2  & Column 3 & Column 4\\
\midrule
row 1    & data 1   & data 2  & data 3  \\
row 2    & data 4   & data 5\footnotemark[1]  & data 6  \\

\botrule
\end{tabular}
\footnotetext{Source: This is an example of table footnote. This is an example of table footnote.}
\footnotetext[1]{Example for a first table footnote. This is an example of table footnote.}
\footnotetext[2]{Example for a second table footnote. This is an example of table footnote.}
\end{table}

\noindent The input format for the above table is as follows:

```         
\begin{table}[<placement-specifier>]
\caption{<table-caption>}\label{<table-label>}%
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}

\vfill\eject

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width.
For this, you need to use `\begin{table*}` `...` `\end{table*}` instead of `\begin{table}` `...` `\end{table}` environment.
Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table.
For this, you need to use `\begin{sidewaystable}` `...` `\end{sidewaystable}` instead of `\begin{table*}` `...` `\end{table*}` environment.
This environment puts tables rotated to single column width.
For tables rotated to double column width, use `\begin{sidewaystable*}` `...` `\end{sidewaystable*}`.

\begin{sidewaystable}
\caption{Tables which are too long to fit, should be written using the "sidewaystable" environment as shown here}\label{tab3}

# Figures {#sec6}

As per the \LaTeX standards you need to use eps images for \LaTeX compilation and `pdf/jpg/png` images for `PDFLaTeX` compilation.
Use the `dev` knitr option to use the approrpate format.
This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX and `PDFLaTeX`.
Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file.
Avoid using subfigures.
The command for inserting images for \LaTeX and `PDFLaTeX` can be generalized.
The package used to insert images in `LaTeX/PDFLaTeX` is the graphicx package.
Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

```{r fig1, fig.cap = "This is an example of a caption", fig.width = 5}
plot(pressure)
```

# Algorithms, Program codes and Listings {#sec7}

Packages `algorithm`, `algorithmicx` and `algpseudocode` are used for setting algorithms in \LaTeX using the format:

```         
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{<alg-caption>}\label{<alg-label>}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
. . .
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting `algorithm` environment.
For program codes, the "program" package is required and the command to be used is `\begin{program}` `...` `\end{program}`.
A fast exponentiation procedure:

Similarly, for `listings`, use the `listings` package.
`\begin{lstlisting}` `...` `\end{lstlisting}` is used to set environments similar to `verbatim` environment.
Refer to the `lstlisting` package documentation for more details.

A fast exponentiation procedure:

```{=latex}
\lstset{texcl=true,basicstyle=\small\sf,commentstyle=\small\rm,mathescape=true,escapeinside={(*}{*)}}
\begin{lstlisting}
begin
  for $i:=1$ to $10$ step $1$ do
      expt($2,i$);  
      newline() od                (*\textrm{Comments will be set flush to the right margin}*)
where
proc expt($x,n$) $\equiv$
  $z:=1$;
  do if $n=0$ then exit fi;
     do if odd($n$) then exit fi;                 
        comment: (*\textrm{This is a comment statement;}*)
        $n:=n/2$; $x:=x*x$ od;
     { $n>0$ };
     $n:=n-1$; $z:=z*x$ od;
  print($z$). 
end
\end{lstlisting}
```

```{=latex}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Calculate $y = x^n$}\label{algo1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $n \geq 0 \vee x \neq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$ 
\State $y \Leftarrow 1$
\If{$n < 0$}\label{algln2}
        \State $X \Leftarrow 1 / x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow -n$
\Else
        \State $X \Leftarrow x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow n$
\EndIf
\While{$N \neq 0$}
        \If{$N$ is even}
            \State $X \Leftarrow X \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N / 2$
        \Else[$N$ is odd]
            \State $y \Leftarrow y \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N - 1$
        \EndIf

# Cross referencing {#sec8}

Figures and tables are labeled with a prefix (fig or tab, respectively) plus the chunk label.
Other environments such as equation and align can be labelled via the `\label{#label}` command inside or just below the `\caption{}` command.
You can then use the label for cross-reference.
As an example, consider the chunk label declared for Figure \ref{fig:fig1} which is fig1.
To cross-reference it, use the command `Figure \ref{fig:fig1}`, for which it comes up as "Figure \ref{fig:fig1}".

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm \ref{algo1} is `\label{algln2}`.
To cross-reference it, use the command `\ref{algln2}` for which it comes up as line \ref{algln2} of Algorithm \ref{algo1}.
