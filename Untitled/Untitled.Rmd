  Behavior scientists have multiple options for managing research data. While relational databases offer robust tools for storage and analysis, they impose structural constraints that limit the representation of complex behavioral phenomena. This article argues that graph databases provide a rigorous and conceptually richer alternative, enabling the modeling of human behavior as an interconnected system rather than a set of isolated variables. Beyond a technological shift, adopting graph-based approaches invites a paradigm change in behavior science—one that embraces complexity, dynamic relationships, and multi-level contingencies. Practical implications are illustrated through examples from clinical, consumer, and industrial/organizational psychology.

# Introduction {#sec1}

In a recent paper, @soto2025 introduced relational databases for behavior science and used real-world examples to illustrate how relational databases have been used by behavior scientists.
Even though relational databases represent the dominant paradigm inside and outside academic research settings, other paradigms are gaining traction.
The so-called "Not Only Relational Database" encompasses a series of database management systems that use single data structures to hold information.
There are several instances of single data structures such as lists, key-value pairs, wide columns, documents, matrices, or graphs.

In this article, I examine graphs as a different paradigm from the traditional paradigm of relational databases, where nodes and edges (instead of tables and joins) represent the basic elements of any behavior that can be represented as a network or complex system.
Networks have a long history in mathematics as "*graph theory*" [@Estrada2011].
In sociology and social sciences, graph theory is known as "social network analysis" [@Wasserman1994], and psychologists have leveraged this framework to analyze the structure of psychopathology [@borsboom2013], estimate the correct number of dimensions in psychological and educational instruments [@golino2017], or understand the measurement of organizational climate [@menezes2021].

# Network as a collection nodes and edges {#sec2}

One of the easiest way to grasp the idea of a network is by looking its visual representation (see Figure [1](#fig:F1)).
According to @Estrada2011, a network is a collection of points (called nodes) joined together in pairs by lines (called arcs or edges).
Scientists can model different kinds of networks from physical networks (e.g., flights between airports) to biological networks (e.g., protein-protein interactions), and social networks (e.g., who follows whom in LinkedIn or X).
In this context, the term "social network" should not be confused with online platforms such as Facebook or Instagram, as they are technological implementations that do not necessarily represent all aspects of social networks as an academic discipline.

Graphs offer fundamental concepts for understanding how entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) form interconnected structures.
Network structures underpin a wide range of behavioral phenomena —from disease transmission and social clustering to the spread of information and misinformation.
As we have mentioned above, the recognition of these patterns requires tools that go beyond the rigid tabular constraints of relational databases.
As the concepts of graphs are thoroughly covered in introductory texts [@Newman2010], these will not be revisited here.
Instead, this article aims to illustrate how graph-based databases can enrich the methodological toolbox of behavior scientists, enabling analyses that embrace complexity, dynamic relationships, and multi-level contingencies [@Robinson2015].

# Graph databases: A gentle introduction

@Robinson2015 define a graph database as a system that implements **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD) operations on a graph data model, where entities are represented as nodes and relationships as edges.
Unlike relational databases, which organize data in tables (columns as variables, rows as cases, and cells containing specific information for each case-variable combination), graph databases treat relationships as first-class elements rather than secondary links between tables. This design enables efficient traversal and pattern matching across highly connected data, making it ideal for modeling complex networks such as behavioral contingencies or social interactions. 

In Figure [2](#fig:F2) we can see a graph of three X users (i.e., Tom, Paul, and Anna) and three messages (i.e., 99, 100, and 101). Tom is followed by Anna and Paul, Tom follows both Anna and Paul, but Paul does not follow Anna, who has a string of messages. Her most recent message can be found by following a relationship marked CURRENT, and the PREVIOUS relationships then create Anna’s timeline.

```{r F2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A visual representation of a graph database", fig.align="center", out.height="180px", out.width="120px", fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/jcc/Documents/GitHub/NOSQLINBS/F2.png")
```

A graph database like the one depicted in Figure [2](#fig:F2) leverages the 
"labeled property graph" which has the following characteristics: 1) it contains nodes and relationships, 2) Nodes contain properties (key-value pairs), 3) Nodes can be labeled with one or more labels, 4) Relationships are named and directed, and always have a start and end node, 5) Relationships can also contain properties.

## Benefits of graph databases.

According to @Robinson2015, a compelling reason for choosing a graph database is  the sheer performance increase when dealing with connected data versus relational databases. In contrast to relational databases, where join-intensive query performance deteriorates as the dataset gets bigger, with a graph database performance remain relatively constant, even as the dataset grows with millions of records. This is because queries are localized to a portion of the graph (the specific edge(s) to be consulted). As a result, the execution time for each query is proportional only to the size of the part of the graph traversed to satisfy that query, rather than the size of the overall graph.
